# Fish Mix Skin #
This skin is made using some of my own resources as well as components from [y36](https://osu.ppy.sh/u/y36), [Haskorion](https://osu.ppy.sh/u/haskorion), [xi9w](https://osu.ppy.sh/u/xi9w), [MeowPaz](https://osu.ppy.sh/u/meowpaz), and [charuri](https://osu.ppy.sh/u/charuri).

## Updates: ##
- Fish Mix v1 - Initial version
- Fish Mix v1.1 - Update skin elements (using a very slightly different color scheme which should be easier on the eyes)
- Fish Mix v1.2 - Use skin elements from the O2Jam U Ultimate skin for mania.
- Fish Mix v1.3 - Hit elements are darker so Kiai time is less distracting.

# Osu Fish New Project #
This project is my attempt to make an osu skin from scratch

# Fish Skin (the first skin I made) #
Osu Fish Skin Final Version (will be released officially if all owners of the original files give the ok)

This Osu Skin is made with pieces from Cookiezi's old skin (SameSkinButNoHitCirclesWierdName) as well as the charui_skin_1_2, Brighter-Lights, and various elements from http://osuskinner.com/

I plan on redoing most of this skin in a Ship of Theseus style (little by litle one piece at a time until the whole thing is different).
I have started a new skin from scratch (not using any elements from existing skins) at OsuFishNew: https://github.com/mrlinuxfish/OsuFishNew


## Updates: ##
- Fish 1.2.2 - Changed sliderpoints and object numbers to match score and combo numbers.
- Fish 1.2.3 - Changed Cursor, Menu button backgrounds, Input overlay, and Menu background images.
